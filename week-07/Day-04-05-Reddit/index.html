          the sidebar" are worthless.)</span>
        <h2>☞ ☞ SUBMISSIONS SHOULD DEAL WITH CONSPIRACY THEORIES, NOT SOMETHING STUPID A POLITICIAN, CELEBRITY, PERSON OR GROUP
          SAID OR DID. ☜ ☜</h2>
        <span>1- DON'T TROLL. Don't attack others or engage in personal spats (back-and-forth of a personal nature), submissions
          or comments that contribute little to dialogue.</span>
        <span>2- NO INFLAMMATORY OR INSULTING COMMENTS THAT DERAIL DISCUSSION</span>
        <span>3- DON'T POST "HELP REQUESTS”, “JUST ASKING QUESTIONS" POSTS OR SIMILAR POSTS such as (but not limited to) vote requests,
          self-promoting posts, “Ask Me Anything” posts, etc.</span>
        <span>4- DON'T POST ANYTHING WITH 'OFFICIAL' IN IT so that it seems to be the voice of this subreddit.</span>
        <span>5- DON'T POST PERSONAL INFORMATION, even your own.</span>
        <span>6- ALL CONTENT CAN BE REMOVED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE MODERATORS. Replies to inappropriate comments may be removed.
          To dispute a removal, please politely message the moderators.</span>
        <span>7- WHEN APPROPRIATE, TAG THE SUBMISSION'S TITLE - for example, [SATIRE] or [CAUTION:
          <tag of your choice>]" (e.g., "NSFW", "possibly NSFW", "graphic images", "racist site")].</span>
        <span>8- SUBMISSION TITLES SHOULD DESCRIBE WHAT IT IS ABOUT. People should be able to know what it is about without clicking
          on the submission. Not something like "I don't even...", "No", "So brave", "This is creepy", "Note the comments",
          etc. Don't editorialize titles.</span>
        <span>9- NO MEME OR IMAGE MACRO POSTINGS</span>
        <span>10- NO DIRECT LINKS TO IMAGES OR IMAGE SITES (Imgur, Tinypic, etc.).</span>
